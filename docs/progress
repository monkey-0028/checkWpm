 
 * Created a file called init.dir that will initilize all
 the required directory for the project.

 * def.h will be in same dir as main.c and will contain $HOME address for 
 include statement
  def.h will be generated by "init.dir"  

HOME is char * generated by "init.dir"

Keep the backup of header and other files here.

* create a function header file called address that will update a 
global char * variable that will represent the address of required file in 
the main.c

----------------------
Discarded the idea of creating main.c as command. 
instead, we will use the idea of shortcut from windows
ie. i will create the whole project, assuming the current
dir as main-dir and after project completion,  i will create bash
script that will act like shortcut for this application and will be 
able to act like command as well.
