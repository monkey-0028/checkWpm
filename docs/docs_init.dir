This file Creates the required directory in the $HOME

if any directory is deleted, it will just create that deleted
directory without touching other directories.

it also generated a char * HOME and created a file named 
"def.h" where ./init.dir is executed.
Make sure to execute init.dir in the same dir as the main.c
because generated file "def.h"	will get included in the main.c
